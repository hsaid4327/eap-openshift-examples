# Summary

This application is a Jakarta 8 application based on the EAP 7.4 quickstarts kitchensink application. It is intended to work with MYSQL database. MYSQL datasource is setup in the 
EAP configuration file. It builds the WAR artifcat, ROOT.war and places it in opensfhit/deployments directory. This is then used for binary deployment on OCP cluster.

# Prerequisites

## Openshift
There is an openshift cluster available to build and deploy the application image

# Steps
## Build Application
From the application root directory:
```
 mvn clean install
```
## Create OCP Project
```
 oc new-project eap-test-project
```
## Deploy MYSQL database on OCP
```
  oc new-app --name mysql openshift/mysql-ephemeral -p MYSQL_USER=<username> -p MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password> -p MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root-password>
```
## OCP Build
Create secret
note: the credentials are what you provided while creating the MYSQL database in the previous step
```
oc create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=MYSQL_USER=<username> --from-literal=MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
```
Create build manifest and start build

```
oc new-build --name=hsaid-eap-jdk8 --binary=true --docker-image registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap74-openjdk8-openshift-rhel8:latest 
cd openshift
oc start-build hsaid-eap-jdk8 --from-dir=.
```
## Deploy the applicaton image

```
oc new-app --name=hsaid-eap-jdk8 -i hsaid-eap-jdk8
oc scale --replicas=0 deployment/hsaid-eap-jdk8
oc set env --from=secret/db-secret deployment/hsaid-eap-jdk8
oc scale --replicas=1 deployment/hsaid-eap-jdk8

```
## Create Route for external access

```
 oc expose svc/hsaid-eap-jdk8

```
